      Hans Christian Andersen, born in Denmark in 1805, practically invented
      the writing of eventyrs; the adventure fairy tale, or fantastic tale.
      Although he wrote a broad range of work, including plays, travelogues,
      novels, and poems, it was his fairy tales that became culturally iconic in
      the Western world. His tales transcend age barriers, national and cultural
      boundaries and have been translated into more than 125 languages. Many of
      his stories are featured in our collection of Favorite Fairy Tales. <br> <br>
      His stories have inspired countless plays, ballets, and movies. Who hasn't
      read or seen an animated movie adaptation of Thumbelina (1835), The
      Emperor's New Clothes (1837), The Little Mermaid (1836), and The Princess
      and the Pea (1835?) <br><br>
      Andersen also blessed us with one of the saddest but most poignant and
      beautiful Christmas stories of all time, The Little Match Girl (also known
      as The Little Matchstick Girl). We encourage teachers and students to use
      our Study Guide. <br> <br>
      Andersen has a number of exemplary, lesser known stories, worthy of your
      attention and offered right here on American Literature.com. Consider

      In 1847 on his first visit to Britain, Andersen met Charles Dickens.
      Andersen wrote in his diary, "We had come to the veranda, I was so happy
      to see and speak to England's now living writer, whom I love the most."
      ("Hcandersen-homepage.dk. 2001-12-30). Both authors focused on the poor
      and underprivileged, tales of transcendence to a better life through hard
      work, guts, and good fortune. <br> <br>
      Andersen's stories laid the groundwork for other children's classics,
      such as The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame and Winnie the Pooh by
      A.A. Milne. It's as if Andersen was a pre-ordained Disney writer, with his
      penchant for making inanimate objects, like toys, come to life and have
      adventures appealing to people of all ages he created a series of timeless
      classics. Andersen was a master writer whose work and themes have been
      emulated throughout time, and through a broad spectrum of platforms. <br><br>
      Andersen died on August 4, 1875 in Copenhagen, having never fully
      recovered from an injury he sustained after falling out of his bed two
      years earlier. <br><br>
