      Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a princess; but
      she would have to be a real princess. He travelled all over the world to
      find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted. There were princesses
      enough, but it was difficult to find out whether they were real ones.
      There was always something about them that was not as it should be. So he
      came home again and was sad, for he would have liked very much to have a
      real princess. <br><br>
      One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning,
      and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking was heard at
      the city gate, and the old king went to open it. <br><br>
      It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But, good
      gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water
      ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes
      and out again at the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess. <br><br>

    <p class="paragraph_2">
      Well, we'll soon find that out, thought the old queen. But she said
      nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead,
      and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid
      them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses. <br><br>
      On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked
      how she had slept. <br><br>
      Oh, very badly! said she. I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven
      only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that
      I am black and blue all over my body. Its horrible! <br><br>
      Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea
      right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds. <br><br>
      Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that. <br><br>
      So the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had a real
      princess; and the pea was put in the museum, where it may still be seen,
      if no one has stolen it.<br><br>
      There, that is a true story.
