                During the night, the magic beans cause a gigantic beanstalk
                to grow outside Jack's window. The next morning, Jack climbs
                the beanstalk to a land high in the sky. He finds an enormous
                astle and sneaks in. Soon after, the castle's owner, a giant,
                returns home.

                  One stormy night a young woman drenched with rain seeks shelter
                  in the prince's castle. She claims to be a princess, so the
                  prince's mother decides to test their unexpected, unwitting
                  guest by placing a pea in the bed she is offered for the night,
                  covered by huge mattresses and 20 feather-beds.

              <h2><b>The Three Little Pigs</b></h2>
              <p>
                  The story begins with the three little pigs being sent out
                  into the world by their mother, to "seek out their fortune."
                  The first little pig builds a house of straw, but a wolf blows
                  it down and devours him. The second little pig builds a house
                  of sticks, which the wolf also blows down, and the second
                  little pig is also devoured. What is going to happen to the
                  third pig?

              <h2><b>The Tortoise And The Hare</b></h2>
              <p>
                The story concerns a Hare who ridicules a slow-moving
                Tortoise. Tired of the Hare's arrogant behavior, the Tortoise
                challenges him to a race.[2] The hare soon leaves the tortoise
                behind and, confident of winning, takes a nap midway through
                the race.

                A childless old woman bakes a gingerbread man, who leaps from
                her oven and runs away. The woman and her husband give chase,
                but are unable to catch him. The gingerbread man then outruns
                several farm workers and farm animals.

                On Christmas Eve night, while his wife and children sleep, a
                father awakens to noises outside his house. Looking out the
                window, he sees Santa Claus in an air-borne sleigh pulled by
                eight reindeer. After landing his sleigh on the roof, the saint
                enters the house through the chimney, carrying a sack of toys
                with him.
