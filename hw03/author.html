        Hans Christian Andersen, born in Denmark in 1805, practically invented
        the writing of eventyrs; the adventure fairy tale, or fantastic tale.
        Although he wrote a broad range of work, including plays, travelogues,
        novels, and poems, it was his fairy tales that became culturally iconic in
        the Western world. His tales transcend age barriers, national and cultural
        boundaries and have been translated into more than 125 languages. Many of
        his stories are featured in our collection of Favorite Fairy Tales. <br> <br>
        His stories have inspired countless plays, ballets, and movies. Who hasn't
        read or seen an animated movie adaptation of Thumbelina (1835), The
        Emperor's New Clothes (1837), The Little Mermaid (1836), and The Princess
        and the Pea (1835?) <br><br>
        Andersen also blessed us with one of the saddest but most poignant and
        beautiful Christmas stories of all time, The Little Match Girl (also known
        as The Little Matchstick Girl). We encourage teachers and students to use
        our Study Guide.

        In 1847 on his first visit to Britain, Andersen met Charles Dickens.
        Andersen wrote in his diary, "We had come to the veranda, I was so happy
        to see and speak to England's now living writer, whom I love the most."
        ("Hcandersen-homepage.dk. 2001-12-30). Both authors focused on the poor
        and underprivileged, tales of transcendence to a better life through hard
        work, guts, and good fortune. <br> <br>
        Andersen's stories laid the groundwork for other children's classics,
        such as The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame and Winnie the Pooh by
        A.A. Milne. It's as if Andersen was a pre-ordained Disney writer, with his
        penchant for making inanimate objects, like toys, come to life and have
        adventures appealing to people of all ages he created a series of timeless
        classics. Andersen was a master writer whose work and themes have been
        emulated throughout time, and through a broad spectrum of platforms. <br><br>
        Andersen died on August 4, 1875 in Copenhagen, having never fully
        recovered from an injury he sustained after falling out of his bed two
        years earlier. <br><br>
